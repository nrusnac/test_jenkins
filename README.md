# test_jenkins

Demo full-stack app for testing Jenkins pipelines.

| Part | Stack | Build tool |
|------|-------|-----------|
| `backend/` | Java 25, zero-dependency HTTP server, JUnit 6 | Gradle 9.6.1 (wrapper) |
| `frontend/` | React 19, Vite 8, Vitest 4 | Yarn 4.17.0 (pinned in-repo) / npm |
| `Jenkinsfile` | Declarative pipeline: build + test both parts, JUnit reports, archived artifacts | — |

## Backend

```sh
cd backend
./gradlew build      # compile + run JUnit tests + assemble jar
./gradlew run        # serve http://localhost:8081/api/hello (PORT env var overrides)
```

The Gradle wrapper downloads Gradle 9.6.1 automatically; the foojay toolchain
resolver auto-provisions JDK 25 if the machine doesn't have one (a JDK 17+ is
still needed to launch Gradle itself).

Try it: `curl 'http://localhost:8081/api/hello?name=Jenkins'` → `{"message":"Hello, Jenkins!"}`

Note: the backend defaults to port **8081** because Jenkins itself usually
occupies 8080.

## Frontend

```sh
cd frontend
yarn install         # Yarn 4.17.0 is committed in .yarn/releases — any yarn launcher delegates to it
yarn test            # Vitest unit tests
yarn build           # production bundle in dist/
yarn dev             # dev server; fetches the greeting from the backend
```

npm works too (`npm install && npm test && npm run build`) — but stick to one
lockfile; the repo commits `yarn.lock`.

## Jenkins setup

1. New Item → **Pipeline** (or Multibranch Pipeline).
2. Definition: *Pipeline script from SCM* → Git → `https://github.com/nrusnac/test_jenkins.git`, branch `main`, script path `Jenkinsfile`.
3. Agent requirements: JDK 17+ and Node.js 20+ on the PATH. Yarn is optional —
   the pipeline installs the launcher if missing, and the pinned Yarn 4.17.0
   release is committed to the repo.

The pipeline publishes JUnit test results from both parts and archives the
backend jar plus the frontend `dist/` bundle on success.
